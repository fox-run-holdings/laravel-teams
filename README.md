## üõ£Ô∏è Routing

The package provides a simplified routing structure that matches Laravel Jetstream's team management:

### Team Management Routes

- **`/team`** - Team creation and listing (when no team is selected)
- **`/team/{team_id}/manage`** - Team management (settings, members, invitations)

### URL Examples

- `/team` - View all teams, create new team, or select existing team
- `/team/123/manage` - Manage team with ID 123 (settings, members, invitations)

## üéØ User Interface

### Navbar Team Dropdown

The package automatically adds a team dropdown to your navbar that:

- **Shows current team** or "No team" if none selected
- **Lists all user's teams** in a dropdown
- **Allows team switching** by clicking "Switch to" for other teams
- **Provides "Manage Team"** link for current team
- **Provides "Create New Team"** option
- **Highlights current team** with a checkmark

### Team Management Pages

#### Team Creation (`/team`)
- Create new teams
- View all teams user belongs to
- Switch between teams
- Delete teams (if owner)

#### Team Management (`/team/{team_id}/manage`)
- Team settings (name, slug)
- Member management
- Team invitations
- Role management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The package configuration is located in `config/teams.php`. You can customize:

### Basic Configuration
```php
return [
    'roles' => [
        'owner' => [
            'permissions' => ['*'], // All permissions
        ],
        'admin' => [
            'permissions' => ['read', 'write', 'delete', 'invite'],
        ],
        'member' => [
            'permissions' => ['read', 'write'],
        ],
        'viewer' => [
            'permissions' => ['read'],
        ],
    ],
];
```

## üîß Usage

### Basic Team Operations

```php
// Get user's teams
$teams = auth()->user()->teams;

// Get current team
$currentTeam = auth()->user()->currentTeam;

// Switch to a team
auth()->user()->switchTeam($team);

// Check if user belongs to team
if (auth()->user()->belongsToTeam($team)) {
    // User is a member
}

// Get user's role in team
$role = auth()->user()->getTeamRole($team);
```

### Team Model Operations

```php
// Create a team
$team = Team::create([
    'name' => 'My Team',
    'owner_id' => auth()->id(),
]);

// Add user to team
$team->users()->attach($userId, ['role' => 'member']);

// Check permissions
if ($team->userHasPermission(auth()->id(), 'write')) {
    // User can write to team
}
```

### Middleware

The package includes middleware to ensure users have teams:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'ensure.user.has.team'])->group(function () {
    // Routes that require a team
});
```

## üé® Customization

### Custom Team Roles

You can customize team roles in `config/teams.php`:

```php
'roles' => [
    'owner' => [
        'permissions' => ['*'],
    ],
    'admin' => [
        'permissions' => ['read', 'write', 'delete', 'invite'],
    ],
    'member' => [
        'permissions' => ['read', 'write'],
    ],
    'viewer' => [
        'permissions' => ['read'],
    ],
],
```

### Custom Views

Publish the views to customize the UI:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-teams-views
```

### Custom Components

Extend the Livewire components to add custom functionality:

```php
class CustomTeamComponent extends \FoxRunHoldings\LaravelTeams\Livewire\Settings\Teams\Teams
{
    // Add your custom logic
}
```
